		<p class="info"> So a little background on the logo. I wanted to make something thatI felt represented by. The first major feature is the C which is my fist initial. The C is also very similar to the Chicago Cubs I am from chicago. The eye often reffered to as the window into the soul tells alot about someone. It looking upwards symbolizes striving for the top. The eye viens are a representation of my work ethic and grit. And the eye veins look like the traces on a motherboard. Which symbolizes the new techonolgy based world we live in</p>

	<h1>Hi, im Charles</h1>
	
	<h2 class="researchText">So, about me Im a 20 year old Mexican American living on Chicago's soutside. I am currently finishing up my second year of studies at Columbia College of Chicago. One thing I am very passionate about is fitness. For me achieving a good physique is of the least importance. What I really enjoy about fitness is the lessons it teaches you about how life works. My favorite lesson I've learned since exercising consitently is that everyting in this life is like a muscle and it can get stronger through training and being consistent. I've always been infactuated with computers and hard work. Which is why I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science. </h2>
