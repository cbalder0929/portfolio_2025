The C is also very similar to the Chicago Cubs I am from chicago. The eye often reffered to as the window into the soul tells alot about someone. It looking upwards symbolizes striving for the top. The eye viens are a representation of my work ethic and grit. And the eye veins look like the traces on a motherboard. Which symbolizes the new techonolgy based world we live in</p>

	<h1 class="researchTitle">Charles Balderas on the “The Way to Wealth” by Benjaman Franklin</h1>
	
	<h2 class="researchSub">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="researchText">               For my final web development project, my plan is to make a website to help me be the type of guy I always wanted to be as a kid. However, as I’ve done more research, I’m noticing that it’s not as fun as I thought it was going to be, and the product is not as engaging as I wanted it to be. I do like that I have the freedom to research whatever I want, which I do enjoy. But I have a very short attention span and maybe that’s why I’m losing interest. Mentioning my attention span, this week I want to share about a book I read. I was in the library looking around for some material to start learning Mandarin. As I was looking around, I stumbled into the technology and finance section. These happen to be topics that I am very passionate about recently so once again my attention span gets me and I spent some time flipping through the books.</p>
	


	<h2 class="researchSub">Stand Out Concepts</h2>
	
	<p class="researchText">               The book I want to share my opinion about today is “The Way to Wealth” by Benjamin Franklin. This book grasps my attention because it was small and short. The design of the book also tugged at me to investigate further; it’s a leather book with gold lettering. But what finally convinced me that it was something worth reading was the fact that it was about wealth. So, I thought to myself “my god, what a great book this must be.” Short, about money and written by none other than the man on the hundred-dollar bill. Who knows more about money than the guy on the hundred.<br></br>
	First, things first. There were some things in this manifesto, as he likes to call it, that I liked and there were also things that I didn’t like. One thing I found very admirable was the purpose behind the commission of this manifesto. From my understanding Benjamin Franklin wrote this essay to educate us simpletons that don’t have quite as much ram in our brains as he does. I think people that take initiative in this manner are very important for our progression as a species. What I didn’t like about this same purpose is that he comes off as if he thinks he is better than most people and this was evident by the way he referred to his servants. In his manifest he sees as though he is doing his servants a favor by being himself. So, yeah he’s a bit of a prick but I guess he does have the merit to back it up. The entire thing is written in old English just as he would’ve wrote it, this made it very difficult to understand. The good thing about the book is that it had captions that explained his point in modern English. In this essay the main gist of the teachings are to do business and make wise decisions. More specifically he touches on not being so trusting of business partners. He argues that the state of lives is one’s own fault. He emphasizes this by stating that if you wake up early and are always working hard you will never suffer. While there is a large amount of truth in what he is saying I don’t think he realized the privilege he had as a rich studious white guy. The part that really got me thinking was the message he was sharing because as I read, I thought to myself this is all stuff I already know. This made me think either this guy is giving very cliché advice, or he is the originator for this advice and it was so revolutionary that everyone in the modern world heard about it and passed it on to every generation.</p>
	
	<h2 class="researchSub">My Opinion</h2>
	
	<p class="researchText">               Which brings us into our next point of observation question. What was the significance of this piece of writing? To that I would answer, this essay has had so much influence on the American people that at this point the teachings in this writing are almost second nature to us. I have been around so many different people and I would say that Americans are some of the most frugal, antisocial, and materialistic people around. Americans are mostly associated with things like obesity, fancy cars, big houses, and entitlement. I think this comes from the knowledge that was being spread at the time by the more influential people like Benjamin Franklin and the founding fathers. <br></br>      Another question a reader might ask is how this has anything to do with the goal of my project. My project is loosely themed around personal wellness. In our journey to become the best versions of ourselves we can learn a couple things from this piece of writing. An observation I have made is as things sit in life they are very one side or the other. Like Benjamin Franklin’s point of view. His teachings are very me, me, me money, my country and we cannot argue this outlook can clearly be associated with growth it also has unintended consequences. Studies have been published for years now, we all have seen the of how Americas are so sad all the time and we have all the psychological hiccups. But if we zoom out even further and observe less prosperous countries for example Mexico or Africa. AN example I can vividly remember is one time as a 3rd grader we watched this documentary of how people from the African bush could literally not comprehend suicide. I clearly remember one of the people in the interview being asked would you want to go to American and he immediately questions them back. “No, Isn’t that the place where people jump of buildings?” Another example I can think of is I saw somewhere on Instagram that the social life of Mexico has shown to result in longer and happier lives. While I don’t have formal sources I can say that if people are saying this it must be true. </p>
<h2 class="researchSub">Final Thoughts</h2>
	
	<p class="researchText">               I also support this idea based off my own observations and those of others I’ve spoken with. But we also have to look at more developed nations such as China and Japan. The leading nations in technological advancements no doubt but they also have very high suicide rates, very high tobacco and alcohol usage.
	<br></br>
	The inference I’ve drawn is that we need to stop being so hot or cold. This team or that team. I think life needs to be balanced. Both good and bad must exist to give each other meaning.  A religion I really like is the ying and yang. To be 100% honest I know nothing about the religion. All the information I know is from, the karate kid, kung fu panda and simply from observing the symbol itself. But what I’ve learned is we as students of life need to forever seek the perfect balance. We must learn to come to terms with the bad days learn to accept and love them. Experience the full spectrum of ups and downs that life has to offer. We must not fall too in love with the good times and we must not hate the bad times so much simply observe them for what they are and not question either of them and learn what you need to learn form both.</p>
