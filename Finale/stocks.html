		<p class="info"> So a little background on the logo. I wanted to make something thatI felt represented by. The first major feature is the C which is my fist initial. The C is also very similar to the Chicago Cubs I am from chicago. The eye often reffered to as the window into the soul tells alot about someone. It looking upwards symbolizes striving for the top. The eye viens are a representation of my work ethic and grit. And the eye veins look like the traces on a motherboard. Which symbolizes the new techonolgy based world we live in</p>

	<h1 class="researchTitle">What is the Stock Market ?</h1>
	
	<h2 class="researchSub">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="researchText">               Alright, one thing I like to elaborate in my writing is the situation I found myself in while writing and the thought process behind the idea. I also love talking about myself, one thing I really enjoy is killing two birds with one stone. With this in mind I thought to myself what I can research and write about that would serve as a good piece of content for my final website, while getting me closer to meeting other goals I have set for myself. I work at a tax firm with my godmother, and we’ve been very busy recently. But during my time at work there have been two things that have kept me sane amid all the numbers. That was the news and stocks. Usually how it goes is I sit at my computer turn the television on and get to work.
	<br></br>     I have become more interested in stocks because lately that’s all they’ve been talking about in the news and because I happened to have been reporting a client’s trades on his taxes. Again, another thing about me is I don’t believe anything that I haven’t seen for myself. All throughout highs school I heard about trading and what not but I never believed in them because to me there was no way you could make money online without doing any work. My mind changed when I got to see the profits this lady was able to generate last year. So, with the context provided I want the purpose of this essay to be further understanding the stock market and politics.</p>
	<h2 class="researchSub">What are Tariffs?</h2>
	<p class="researchText">      I’m sure everyone has heard about the tariff situation that is currently taking place. With this paragraph I am going to try to explain what they are. A tariff is a fee imposed by a government on products at the time of import. There are many reasons why a country imposes tariffs. One reason for tariffs is as a method to generate extra revenue. Since it is sort of a bottle neck area this is one last checkpoint where a government can place a final fee on products before it reaches the end consumer. Another reason for tariffs is to help domestic manufacturers remain competitive in the market. In some cases, foreign countries have the ability to make products much cheaper than domestic manufactures. This price difference encourages consumers to choose the cheaper alternative and poses a threat to domestic producers since they can’t keep up with the prices foreign entities can provide.</p>

	<h2 class="researchSub">International Relations</h2>
	<p class="researchText">      In this case we will be examining the relation between the United states and China because it is a very popular topic right now due to the circumstances, we currently find ourselves in. China and the U.S trade with each other to meet the demands of their population. China and the U.S are an important relation because they are the biggest and most powerful countries right now and they are each other’s umber one trade partners. However as iterated before China can produce things at a much cheaper price so people gravitate toward buying their product. This has created a trade deficit. A trade deficit is when a country buys more than they can sell. On the surface this doesn’t seem like such a big deal, which is initially what I thought. Who cares that they make things cheaper good for them right? The dangerous thing about this is the nature of humans. We are a very nasty territorial creature. If a country is making so many sales our money is circulating in their economy, making them stronger and making our money worth less. But even scarier is what they can do with their increasing production power. To observe this we can take a look back to world war 2. At the time the U.S was the top producer in the world we had so many factories churning products out. When the war started all of these factories were repurposed to help the war effort. I believe this is the president’s biggest concern with China. They have so many efficient factories that can easily be converted into weapon and supply factories that would aid them in defeating any foe they face. What made this concern even more real is the fact that China produced 11 warship in 2024 with plans in 2025 to expand their fleet by 400 warships.<br></br>      What Donald Trump is trying to do with these absurd tariffs is bring back some of that global power that we have handed over to China. The sharp price increase on imported good should make consumers gravitate toward cheaper domestically sourced products and bring some of the production back to the United States. This is basically the situation that has the whole U.S stock market’s panties in a bunch which is what we are going to get into in this next section.</p>
	<h2 class="stocksubtitles">Stonks</h2>
	<p class="stockText">       What the actual flip is the stock market? I ask myself this question almost everyday it just doesn’t fit into my head how you can earn money without doing any work. That goes against everything I have always been taught. But in this paragraph we will be trying to understand what it Is, how it started and why it is not doing so good currently. The stock market is like a giant online marketplace where investors can go to buy shares in a company. This means they own a small percentage of the company and are entitled to compensation in a couple different ways, but first we should clarify why a company would decide to sell small chunks of their company. A company does this in order to make more money seemingly out of thin air. This is the part that I never really understood but that exactly what it is. As an shareholder you don’t exactly get a percentage of the earnings, well in the case of dividend stocks you do get sent money from time to time but not as much as a regular stock. In that scenario you get the earning when you sell you stock to someone else or back to the company. But in this case you are also sharing the risk that the company could go under and you could be left with no money.</p>
	<h2 class="stocksubtitles">Recession</h2>
	<p class="stockText">     According to the internet and media we are currently in the midst of an economic recession. This also confuses me a lot because I look around and everything seems to be pretty much okay. But that’s basically what a recession is it s when things are not going great. We’ve seen some pretty bad ones like in the 1920’s when nobody could access their money. But in this case lets examine what the recession we are currently facing looks like and why it is this way. One big reason I believe we are having recession like symptoms right now is because everyone is just so great. Think about it everyone is going to college, everyone is getting here fitness right. So it’s becoming harder to stand out and be a spectacular candidate for a job.</p>
