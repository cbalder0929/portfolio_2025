		<p class="info"> So a little background on the logo. I wanted to make something thatI felt represented by. The first major feature is the C which is my fist initial. The C is also very similar to the Chicago Cubs I am from chicago. The eye often reffered to as the window into the soul tells alot about someone. It looking upwards symbolizes striving for the top. The eye viens are a representation of my work ethic and grit. And the eye veins look like the traces on a motherboard. Which symbolizes the new techonolgy based world we live in</p>

			<h1>What is the Stock Market ?</h1>
		
			<p class="stockText">  Alright, one thing I like to elaborate in my writing is the situation I found myself in while writing and the thought process behind the idea. I also love talking about myself, one thing I really enjoy is killing two birds with one stone. With this in mind I thought to myself what I can research and write about that would serve as a good piece of content for my final website, while getting me closer to meeting other goals I have set for myself. I work at a tax firm with my godmother, and we’ve been very busy recently. But during my time at work there have been two things that have kept me sane amid all the numbers. That was the news and stocks. Usually how it goes is I sit at my computer turn the television on and get to work.

		<h1>Why are we so stressed when life’s never been better?</h1>
		<p class="skateText">   It is no surprise that times have been changing and so have people. One thing you always hear about from everyone is how stressful everything is. This idea always causes so much confusion in me because I understand and identify with most of those people that are stressed but the part that puzzled me is my observations of the world. In this article together we will be trying to gain a deeper understanding of why people are so stressed out nowadays and what we can do to fix it. Along the way I will share my personal experiences, my outlook on the situation and how I manage stress.

		<h1>Charles Balderas on the “The Way to Wealth” by Benjiman Franklin</h1>
		<p class="benjiText">      For my final web development project, my plan is to make a website to help me be the type of guy I always wanted to be as a kid. However, as I’ve done more research, I’m noticing that it’s not as fun as I thought it was going to be, and the product is not as engaging as I wanted it to be. I do like that I have the freedom to research whatever I want, which I do enjoy. But I have a very short attention span and maybe that’s why I’m losing interest. Mentioning my attention span, this week I want to share about a book I read. I was in the library looking around for some material to start learning Mandarin. As I was looking around, I stumbled into the technology and finance section. These happen to be topics that I am very passionate about recently so once again my attention span gets me and I spent some time flipping through the books.<button class="buttonn" onclick="window.location.href='benjamin.html'">Read More &#187;</button></p>
