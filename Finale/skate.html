		<p class="info"> So a little background on the logo. I wanted to make something thatI felt represented by. The first major feature is the C which is my fist initial. The C is also very similar to the Chicago Cubs I am from chicago. The eye often reffered to as the window into the soul tells alot about someone. It looking upwards symbolizes striving for the top. The eye viens are a representation of my work ethic and grit. And the eye veins look like the traces on a motherboard. Which symbolizes the new techonolgy based world we live in</p>

	<h1 class="researchTitle">Why are we so stressed when life’s never been better?</h1>

	<h2 class="researchSub">Introduction</h2>	
	<p class="researchText">               It is no surprise that times have been changing and so have people. One thing you always hear about from everyone is how stressful everything is. This idea always causes so much confusion in me because I understand and identify with most of those people that are stressed but the part that puzzled me is my observations of the world. In this article together we will be trying to gain a deeper understanding of why people are so stressed out nowadays and what we can do to fix it. Along the way I will share my personal experiences, my outlook on the situation and how I manage stress.</p>
	
	<h2 class="researchSub">What is Stress?</h2>	
	<p class="researchText">               Stress is when the body increases the levels of cortisol in the bloodstream. This is a feature that is present in almost all animals and serves as a survival mechanism to signal to the body that it has found itself in an uncomfortable and dangerous situation. However, for humans it is very different, see we have a higher level of cognitive capacity. What does this mean? This means we can anticipate stressors which is a doubled edged sword. On the one hand it can help with preventing something catastrophic like being eaten by a bear because we can realize much earlier than other animals. But this also means that we spend more time in a stressed state.</p> 
	<h2 class="researchSub">Me thinketh</h2>	
	<p class="researchText">               As I said earlier in the introduction stress is very puzzling to especially Americans being stressed. We literally have the least stressful life achievable, yet we manage to always find something to be stressed about. I noticed this because I’ve spent a lot of time with people from Central America and I thought to myself as they shared their stories with me. “These people live stressful lives and have very little money in their countries, yet they are noticeably happier.” My take on this comes from two concepts I learned a lot from and find very comforting. This past tax season I worked with my godmother at her tax preparation firm and during my time there I gained so much experience and learned a lot about life as well. Sometimes when I encounter very complex subjects in life I like to step back and observe. While working with my aunt one of the very first things she taught is accounting is all about checks and balances, everything must equal zero. If you think about it life is very much like this. I believe the reason people in America are becoming more stressed is because our lives are so easy, we literally have nothing to worry about. But that gets boring, so the brain finds little stupid things to worry about and blow them out of proportion. One thing that has helped me with stress is physical fitness and I’m going to explain how it checks all the boxes of the concepts we have discussed in this article. From a primitive perspective exercise is beneficial, historically the strongest humans were the hardest to take food from. Working out makes you stronger so boom checks that box one less thing you must worry about. This is one of my favorite ways to work around things. By the way I like to make ideas easier to digest and solving problems one by one. Another stressors is aging, as you age the body becomes less and less functional. If you exercise say 3-4 hours a week you are doing something that has proven to reduce the effects of aging. As I was saying with accounting, all balances must equal to zero. Your body literally needs some amount of stress to function properly and in exercising you are doing so in a safe way that improves your well-being.</p>
	<h2 class="researchSub">Conclusion</h2>	
	<p class="researchText">               In this article I wrote we have covered what stress is, my view on the whole situation, how I deal with stress and my explanation. If there’s one thing, I want my audience to take away from this article, it is that your mind is a very powerful computer, and you must learn to program it to work for you and to make it yourself to other people. Stress can either control you or you can use it as a superpower that gives endless motivation. I also want my audience to know and remember that you are never alone, people all go through the same things, but I will say just like coding it never gets easier you just get better.
