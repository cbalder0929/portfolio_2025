		  The first idea I read from the design is dead article it says God is dead wuuwuuu because of how smart we have gotten. Then the sentence after says that philosophy and reason alone cannot give the same sense of purpose and morality as religion has over the course of the entire human history and I really agree with that statement which is why I like religion. Next couple of paragraphs start to elaborate how, what it means to be a human is now being questioned again with the emergence of AI. The question now is what things are good for machines to do and what jobs are important for humans to be doing so that life doesn’t become mundane. This idea he presents reminded me of the movie the Giver. In the giver society has essentially reached perfection. In the world of the giver everything is the same and all decisions are controlled by the government. I think that was a really good movie because it’s such a complex subject yet it is so realistic. I still have not been able to conclude whether a utopia of those sorts would be a good thing or a bad thing.
		  I agree with the point the article is trying to make which is that design is a very human thing, it’s part of what makes being alive beautiful. I also understand how they are explaining that leaving this task up to machines can lead the world to become a bland place with nothing that makes humans interesting
		  I’ve thought the same thing that is being argued in the article. Alot of people don't care about the fancy design ideologies that make things pretty some people most actually value function and practicality. Another part I also find scary is how easy and how useful it is to use ai I even catch myself. Like when I need a picture sure I could photoshop the idea into reality but that would take hours and so many headaches and road bumps just to get a marginally better graphic vs I could use ai get an image that does the job and looks decent enough for what I need.  I do think ai integration into every aspect of our lives is a reality that is highly likely. Is this a good thing or bad thing, who knows but I know that we are already well on our way in that direction.
		  This paragraph I'm reading was thinking so far into the future where it says that what if in the future, we have ai assistance that run scans on our body's and make predictive suggestions like buy green tea to reduce cortisol levels, or your cortisol levels are high may I suggest green tea can I buy some. I think like I said earlier this is a reality that we are already heading towards because amazon accidently subscribed me to a dog food and a deodorant subscription and now I get dog food and deodorant whenever I need it don't even have to think it automatically buys and it's so convenient because otherwise I’d have to go to the store lug the stuff I bought around and I'm on the train so it wouldn't be so easy
		  I understand why everyone is terrified, but my upbringing and mentors have always taught me to not be scared no matter how bad the odds are. So, I would have to argue there is no need to be terrified at all instead get excited. The one pattern that is for certain is that as time has passed life has always gotten better and adopting this scary ass mentality is what is bad for everyone.
